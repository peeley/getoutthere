          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>
          Our mission at Get Out There is to give all Alaskans an opportunity
          to grow a passion for outdoor fitness through kindness and
          transparency. We want to bring more positivity and fitness into the
          world by putting a smile on each of our athletes’ faces.
          </p>
          <p>
          We understand that no two athletes are the same, and that’s why we
          have an array of different groups to meet every athlete’s needs.
          You’ll often see our coaches and athletes smiling together helping
          each other work towards individual and group goals.
          </p>

          <h1>Meet Logan</h1>

          Chances are if you’re from Fairbanks you’ve probably met our head
          coach Logan Mowry. Logan loves fitness and the outdoors and wants
          nothing more than to spread his passion to all of Alaska through
          miles and smiles.
          </p>
          <p>
          Logan has competed at the highest level of NCAA’s with cross country skiing as
